# Mind Wars - Alpha Testing User Stories 📖

## Document Purpose

This document provides user stories specifically designed for **Alpha Testing** when backend servers are not yet available. These stories focus on local functionality, UI/UX validation, and pre-production readiness testing.

**Alpha Testing Context**: Since Mind Wars doesn't have servers to host games for multiple players yet, Alpha testing focuses on:
1. **Local authentication** without backend
2. **Single-device testing** of UI/UX flows
3. **Offline gameplay** validation
4. **Build and deployment** process verification
5. **Cross-platform** compatibility testing
6. **Performance and stability** baseline establishment

**Last Updated**: November 12, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Alpha Testing Phase
