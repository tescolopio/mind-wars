## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management**: Used `StatefulWidget` for game-specific state
2. **Game Initialization**: Switch-case pattern for different game types
3. **Generic Fallback**: Graceful handling of unimplemented games
4. **Scoring System**: Unified scoring with time tracking and penalties

### Code Quality

- Clean, readable code with descriptive variable names
- Comprehensive comments explaining game logic
- Consistent code formatting
- Proper error handling
- Material Design 3 compliance

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient state updates using `setState` appropriately
- No unnecessary rebuilds
- Touch-optimized for 5" screens
- Smooth animations and transitions

3. **Multiplayer**: Not available in alpha mode (as expected)
4. **Statistics**: Mock data in leaderboard, stats not yet tracked in profile
5. **Achievements**: Placeholder system, not yet functional
