   - Order of execution planned
   - Risk mitigation strategies

3. **Capacity Check** (15 min)
   - Verify total points vs. capacity
   - Account for holidays, meetings
   - Buffer for unknowns (10-20%)
   - Commit to sprint backlog

### Sprint Velocity Tracking
- **Phase 1 Target**: 40-50 points/sprint (170 points over 4-5 sprints)
- **Phase 2 Target**: 40-50 points/sprint (96 points over 2-3 sprints)
- **Phase 3 Target**: 40-50 points/sprint (89 points over 2-3 sprints)

**Velocity Adjustments**:
- First 2 sprints: Establish baseline
- Sprint 3+: Use 3-sprint average
- Adjust for team changes, holidays
- Account for technical debt sprints

### Story Point Calibration
**Reference Stories** (use for comparison):
- **1 point**: Update button text, fix typo
- **2 points**: Add new UI component (reusable)
- **3 points**: Implement simple API endpoint
- **5 points**: Create new screen with basic logic
- **8 points**: Implement complex feature with state management
- **13 points**: Build complete user flow (auth, lobby creation)

### Risk Management
**High-Risk Items** (need extra attention):
- New technology/library integration
- Cross-platform compatibility issues
- Real-time multiplayer edge cases
- Offline sync conflict resolution
- Security-critical features

**Mitigation**:
- Add buffer points (multiply estimate by 1.5x)
- Spike stories for unknowns
- Pair programming on complex items
- Early integration testing
- Frequent demos to stakeholders
