# Mind Wars 🧠⚔️

**Mind Wars** is an async multiplayer cognitive games platform supporting 2-10 players per lobby with cross-platform support for iOS 14+ and Android 8+.

## Development Philosophy

### Mobile-First 📱
Designed for 5" touch screens, then scales up. All UI elements are touch-optimized with minimum 48dp touch targets.

### Offline-First 📴
All games playable without connectivity. SQLite-based local storage with automatic sync queue and retry logic.

### API-First 🌐
RESTful design enables potential web version. Clean separation between client and server.

### Security-First 🔒
Server-side validation for all game logic. Client is thin client; server is authoritative source of truth.

### Data-Driven 📊
Instrumented analytics for A/B testing. Event-driven architecture for scalability.

### Progressive Enhancement 🚀
Core features first, polish iteratively. Optimistic updates with server confirmation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### Setup

```bash
# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios

# Run on Android emulator
flutter run -d android

# Build for production
flutter build apk          # Android
flutter build ios          # iOS
```

## Alpha Builds

Alpha builds allow you to test the app on your personal device before release.

**📖 For Alpha Testers**: See **[ALPHA_USER_STORIES.md](ALPHA_USER_STORIES.md)** for comprehensive user stories, testing workflows, and acceptance criteria specific to Alpha testing without backend servers.

### Building Alpha Versions Locally

Use the provided build script:

```bash
# Build Android alpha APK
./build-alpha.sh android

# Build iOS alpha (macOS only)
./build-alpha.sh ios

# Build both platforms
./build-alpha.sh both
```

The Android APK will be available at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/mind-wars-v{version}-alpha.apk`

### Using GitHub Actions

Alpha builds can be automatically generated via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select **"Build Alpha APK"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Download the generated APK from the workflow artifacts

### Installing Alpha Builds

**Android:**
1. Transfer the APK to your Android device
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device settings
3. Open the APK file to install
4. The app will appear as "Mind Wars Alpha" with package ID `com.mindwars.app.alpha`

**iOS:**
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Configure signing with your Apple Developer account
3. Connect your device and select it as the target
4. Click "Run" or use Product > Archive for distribution
5. Alternatively, use TestFlight for distributing to testers

### Alpha vs Production

Alpha builds have:
- Different bundle ID (`com.mindwars.app.alpha`) - can install alongside production
- Version suffix `-alpha` (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha`)
- Useful for testing new features without affecting production installs

## Beta Testing

Beta testing validates production readiness with real users in a controlled environment. See **[BETA_TESTING_USER_STORIES.md](BETA_TESTING_USER_STORIES.md)** for:

- **Beta Testing Program**: Complete epics, features, and tasks for beta testing infrastructure
- **Beta Tester Journey**: Detailed user journey from invitation through launch
- **Testing Campaigns**: Structured testing scenarios and focus areas
- **Feedback Collection**: In-app feedback, surveys, and analytics
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs and targets for beta testing program

### Beta vs Alpha

| Aspect | Alpha | Beta |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Environment** | Local builds, dev servers | Hosted production-like servers |
| **Distribution** | Manual APK, TestFlight | TestFlight + Google Play Beta Track |
| **User Base** | Internal team, close contacts | Invited external users (50-100+) |
| **Duration** | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Focus** | Core functionality | Real-world usage, UX, edge cases |
| **Monitoring** | Basic logging | Full analytics, crash reporting, APM |

## Development

```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Run the app with alpha flavor (Android)
flutter run --flavor alpha

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Format code
flutter format lib/
```
