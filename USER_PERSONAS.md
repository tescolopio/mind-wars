## Persona Validation & Evolution

These personas should be validated and refined through:
- Family interviews and surveys (interview entire families, not individuals)
- Multi-generational focus groups
- Beta testing with family units
- Analytics data tracking family vs. public lobby usage
- Parent and child feedback together
- Regular quarterly reviews with family-focused lens

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Percentage of lobbies that are private (family/friends) vs. public
- Age distribution within lobbies (are they multi-generational?)
- Family retention rates vs. individual users
- Multi-device usage patterns within families
- Parent satisfaction with age-appropriateness

As the product evolves, personas may shift or new personas may emerge. This is a living document that should be updated based on real family usage data.
