## Game Overview

### Concept
[2-3 sentence high-level description of the game]

**Example**: "Memory Matrix is a spatial working memory game where players view a grid of highlighted tiles briefly, then recreate the pattern from memory. Players compete asynchronously on achieving the highest grid complexity or total score across 5 rounds."

### Core Gameplay Loop
[Describe the basic cycle of gameplay in 3-5 steps]

**Example**:
1. View grid with highlighted tiles (2 seconds)
2. Tiles disappear, blank grid remains
3. Player taps tiles to recreate pattern
4. Submit answer, see score
5. Next round increases difficulty

### Victory Condition
[How does a player win?]

**Example**: "Highest total score across 5 rounds wins. Scoring awards 250 points per correct tile plus 100-point bonus for perfect rounds."

## Game Mechanics

### Rules

**Setup**:
[Describe initial game state setup]

**Gameplay**:
[Detailed step-by-step gameplay rules]
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. etc.

**Ending**:
[How does the game end?]

**Special Rules**:
- [Any exceptions or special cases]

### Scoring System

**Formula**:
```
[Provide exact scoring formula]
```

**Example**:
```
Base Score = 250 × correct tiles
Perfect Bonus = 100 (if all tiles correct)
Time Bonus = 50 - seconds taken (max 50)
Streak Multiplier = 1 + (current streak × 0.1)

Final Score = (Base Score + Perfect Bonus + Time Bonus) × Streak Multiplier
```

**Scoring Breakdown**:
| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Correct tile | +250 |
| Perfect round | +100 |
| Time bonus | +0 to +50 |
| Hint used | -50 |

**Example Scores**:
- Perfect 3x3 grid (9 tiles), 5 seconds: 250×9 + 100 + 45 = 2,395
- 4 of 5 tiles correct, 12 seconds: 250×4 + 0 + 38 = 1,038

### Difficulty Progression

**Levels/Rounds**:
[Describe how difficulty increases]

**Adaptive Difficulty**:
[If applicable, describe how game adapts to player skill]

**Example**:
- **Round 1-2**: 3x3 grid, 4 tiles
- **Round 3-4**: 4x4 grid, 7 tiles
- **Round 5+**: 5x5 grid, 12 tiles
- **Adaptive**: Add 1 tile for perfect rounds, remove 1 after multiple errors

## Cognitive Value

### Primary Cognitive Skills
[List main cognitive skills trained, with scientific backing if available]

**Example**:
1. **Spatial Working Memory** (Primary)
   - Temporarily store visual-spatial information
   - Effect size: 0.21-0.28 in meta-analyses
   
2. **Visual Attention** (Secondary)
   - Quickly encode multiple spatial locations
   - Selective attention to relevant stimuli

### Scientific Validation

## Async Multiplayer Design

### Async Format
[Describe how async multiplayer works]

**Turn Structure**:

- [Minimum/maximum players]

**Comparison Method**:
[How are players compared? Scores, completion time, etc.]

**Example**:
"Both players receive identical grids in the same order. Each completes 5 rounds independently at their convenience. After both finish, scores are compared. Highest total score wins. Turn timer: 24 hours per complete 5-round match."
